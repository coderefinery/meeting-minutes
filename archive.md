## 2025-05-12 Kick-off agenda

- NRIS contribution unclear at this moment
- AV equipment needed: 
    - room microphone
    - camera
    - RD will bring
- https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/CR4_kickoff

## 2025-04-14 (low period)
- Two people there, not much CR related was discussed

## 2025-04-07 Workshop debrief

- Feedback/lessons learned of the workshop?
    - How many people watch?  This is an important question
    - Questions we would like to answer about attendance:
        - How many from each country (for reporting to local organizations) (twitch and/or youtube stats)
        - How many peolpe interact with the material later (to know how much material is used, especially week 2) (after the stream)
        - (ideally the two combined, but OK if not)
        - Registration and "attendance" by country
        - Can we see trends over time?
    - Everyone, write thoughts in "field report" issue on each lesson
    - Make other issues about major problems
    - Week 2 only demos - why?
        - Difficulty was installation
        - Perhaps set up some environment that people can run in
        - Perhaps set up local (e.g. sweden) install help/standard install instructions
        - sw installation is a big problem for us in each of the countries at the meeting (SE,NO,FI)
        - "cloud environments" one one of our clusters (which still can be used later)?
        - Even having a cloud env that is *not* usable for research after may be better than "don't have any installation or exercises anyway"
        - Keep local installation possibilities
        - Anyway rely more on local partners to make working environments (and others, say "this is only demos, we can't promise you can get an environment working, we are sorry")

- If time: What would you like to discuss during project kick-off?
    - Look at a report of stats (attendance, countries - as above)
    - New training material, new collaborations?
        - AI factories, etc - how to be relevant to them.
    - From ASC meeting: "More peolpe are coding without thinking (because of AI, but it's not much different than copy and paste)".  CR is a way to make people think some, that they realyl need.  How to deal with this.

    - BL, Aalto, CSC support the AI workshop ideas
    - NAISS: different discussions in progress, some people in NAISS very happy with CR and want to continue
    - UiO: plan to hire one person to work on CR ~ full time; thanks to SR
    - NTNU: thanks to BL to get it listed separately
    - Travel money: 
        - Could also be asked from European things
        - Let's ask for what we need to do meaningful week
        - Split team meeting and conference (outreach)
        - Team meetings around conferences?
        - NeiC AHM: we often met there, if not available then we definitely NEED the yearly team meeting. 
    - And for the internal meetings we can also try to brand them so that it applies to our normal jobs, "nordic teaching collaboraiton workshou" instead of "CR team meeting".  This also helps to draw in others
    - NeiC situation: Parent is not anymore Nordforsk, but CSC, Tomasz is director and project owner; funds are managed by CSC, 

- Any questions about NRIS workflows/Snakemake course tomorrow? (potentially moved to CR)
- Collaborative courses last year: Continue?
    - continue collaborations where needed
    - reuse materials
- Website and Lessons analytics
    - We use plausible analytics for non personal data tracking
    - website and lessons
    - Should we continue?
        - not google
        - if no ethical concerns
        - everything that does not require consent
        - lets also use the data in reporting and other
        - unique is an estimate (reset every 6 hours or so)
        - explain in privacy policy
        - how accurate is the tracking? How can it be blocking
    - Course pages: Nordic
    - Integration with CSC Matomo would be good to have it managed somewhere else

- Reserve dates for autumn CR team meeting?
    - Poll for dates and location 
    - Helsinki proposed, but open for others to start 

- RI service staff meeting in Nordics

- NTNU: plan to do C++ course online in Sep?
    - Looking for collaborators; contact BL if interested
    - Email to Alan Simpson, EPCC,
    - Hi Alan,
as I mentioned, I am planning a online C++ for hpc course in the autumn. It will be more or less a copy of Andrew Lumsdaines course, https://lums658.github.io/amath583s19/.
He did this course at the University of Washington in 2017-2019. The lessons are licenced under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. I will use the same licence, but of course credit him as the original author. Beyond basic C++ and the C++ standard template library, Lumsdaine cover also the NVIDIA Thrust library, https://developer.nvidia.com/thrust as a mean to program GPUs and he also touches upon MPI. I am thinking of replacing NVidia Thrust and MPI with lessons on Kokkos, https://github.com/kokkos. Raja, https://github.com/llnl/raja might be an alternative, but currently I don't know
the difference between Kokkos and Raja, and Kokkos seems more well documented.
 
I have asked around in my own organization here at NTNU and in the national HPC-organization, Norwegian Research Infrastructue Services (NRIS), http://www.nris.no, whether someone will do the course with me, but I have not got any positive answers yet. I would be super cool if someone from EPCC would like to join me in this project. Propably we could get some European funding, as there is a range of EU training initiatives in
supercomputing/HPC.
 
What needs to be done is to create example code/tutorials based on the lessons from Lumsdaines course. The lessons probably need to be reframed,
but they can be more less used as they are. I have sofar gone through approximately half of the lessons. Currently I am thinking of using the
CodeRefinery,https://coderefinery.org , teaching setup, where the lessons are given on Zoom but streamed to Twitch. The lessons are recorded and published on YouTube afterwards. CodeRefinery use a shared document to commmunicate with the participants, instead of the Zoom chat. In this
way the questions and answers are documented and available for everyone afterwards. The shared document is also used to share links to the lessons and other resources.
 
I add also a link to a talk Andrew Lumsdaine gave about modern C++ as way to program supercomputers,
Modern C++ for High-Performanc Computing, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05JD2RQdwpo
Modern C++ for High-Performance Computing - slides: https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/cpp4HPC/
 
Look forward to hear from you.
 
Yours sincerely,
Bjørn Lindi

## 2024-11-11 Governance

- We will discuss: https://github.com/coderefinery/governance-charter
- This is about creating a framework for making big-picture decisions about the project and its intellectual property
  - Could you highlight a bit what exactly is different in this governance draft to how it is done now?
    - situation now:
      - governance model is the PPS model (it is a project steering model developed by Tieto-Evry) which defines how projects can be steered and managed with clear roles for project owner (NeIC, TM), project manager, steering group
      - big-picture decisions: steering group
      - day-to-day management: project manager
      - intellectual property management: undefined
      - trademark management: basically undefined
      - "it works" but ...
    - why RB believes we need something different in future:
      - PPS model is good but might not be enough anymore
      - PPS model is more administration-facing but we need something community-facing
      - what if NeIC stops funding it? (it looks like NeIC might continue funding but this was a clear risk)
      - what if NeIC stops to exist? (also this won't happen soon but this was a clear risk)
      - I belive that more than one person should make decisions about this project
      - what if there is disagreement? (not a problem yet)
      - what if somebody has questions about intellectual property and name and logo and labels?
      - clarifying and democtracizing the decision process might make it more inviting for people and organizations to contribute their time and in-kind
  - There is a sentence "We will continue giving courses like we have been doing": This would be interesting to look in deeper. Not necessarily to write it differently in the governance document, but so that all contributors and partners are on same page. We have 2 large tools workshops, and a train the trainer workshop, where the CodeRefinery label is quite clear. We make it happen. But then there is other courses, some of which have a lot of "CR contributions" , others only few. Some are partly advertized as CodeRefinery workshops others mention it in contributions. It would be interesting to look into this more. Whats our training portfolio? Who can put the CR logo on their training etc. Maybe this needs a separate discussion. Just wanted to bring it up now to not forget.
    - our training portfolio: it evolved and it's basically the lessons page but it's organic and needs to be more clearly defined and steered and the document is an attempt to make this easier or even possible
    - who can put the CR logo on their training: same as above. this wasn't clearly defined and it wasn't a big problem yet since we were small but now we are at a size/growth where this needs some structure.
    - RD: I would interpert this as "This document isn't proposing to change anything right now" but it's up to the new advisory board and community to figure out the place for the smaller community workshops.

- Please ask yourself and answer here or in the GitHub repo or in the Google Doc (linked from GitHub repo):
  - Would you be happy to contribute to a project that would be organized and governed that way?
  - Even if you stopped contributing today, would you be comfortable if the outlined organization structure would make decisions about your past contributions? (data, lessons, intellectual property, trademark)
  - What is missing in that document?
  - What would you like to see changed or reformulated?
- Next steps:
  - RB will request comments from NeIC and the steering group
  - Goal is to get this approved before March 1st, 2025

What to modify:
  - [SR] There is no indication on who will look for money ? doean CR need money ? 
     - connection to finances and funding needs to be clarirfied
     - [SR] The governance structure would also depends on how it is funded. 
  - shorten the mission/vision/guiding principles to fewer bullet points (but please help commenting there so that it becomes "our" mission/vision and not one person's)
  - add historical background context to the document to make it clearer why this is needed and what was there before
  - cross-border events might need clearer guidelines about advertising and reporting (can I report a large collaborative workshop as "our" work if "our" contribution was 10% ?)
  - clarify what CodeRefinery workshop means

Summary: 

On Monday, we held our third Ambassador Call, bringing together our ambassador community for another engaging session. After a brief round of introductions, we shared the latest updates and outcomes from previous calls (see [notes](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/team-meeting)).

The following discussion covered a variety of topics, including insights from different organizations on hosting "Bring Your Own Code" or other support sessions, methods for recognizing attendance at CodeRefinery and other workshops ("Do we need an exam?"). We also discussed the prerequisites for computing courses, debating whether introductory "How Computers Work" sessions or basic filesystem knowledge should be required.

If this sounds intriguing, we’d love to have you join the CodeRefinery Ambassador Program! [Sign up](https://postit.csc.fi/sympa/subscribe/coderefinery-ambassadors/) to stay connected. As an ambassador, your role can be as unique as you are — whether it’s sharing information with your network, hosting your own classroom for a CodeRefinery workshop, co-developing lesson materials, or even teaching alongside us. The only requirement? A passion for CodeRefinery and the topics we cover.

Team meeting summary 2024-09-23

We are post-processing the recent online workshop. Next steps
will be to write a short blog post on lessons learned and to document all improvements into manuals, issues, and templates, so that we have this knowledge available next time we run such an event.

Today we also discussed that the more senior instructors can in future focus more on mentoring new instructors. Train-the-trainer workshop could happen "in passing" while we onboard and mentor.

This was our last topical weekly meeting before the summer break but we will continue our weekly co-working sessions every Monday throughout July.

We concluded the first half of 2024 by sharing small or large success stories from our non-CodeRefinery work which was a fun way to learn what our colleagues are working on: really interesting projects.

See you in August at our train-the-trainer workshop! Happy (northern hemisphere) mid-summer!
```


### We restart again in August

## 2024-06-10 CodeRefinery in half a day

- What should be in there if you only had half a day?
   - to be tested at  https://elfi2024.eu/ 
   - take modular code live demo and develop that further
     - grow a tiny project into something larger
     - containerize it
     - turning it into a workflow
     - choice of license
     - put it on github? doing the first commit in the terminal/editor might be easier to follow than on github.
     - cheatsheet
     - publishing
   - exercises could be:
     - talking about topics/questions
     - during discussion sessions, more experienced participants could share their experiences with their groups
   - if we take lessons that we have as starting point:
     - intro to git
     - collaborative git
     - social coding 

- Instructor training
    - CodeRefinery train the trainer in Aug/Sep plan: 
        - 13.8 Episode 1: Lesson template and development, post-workshop survey (aka the source for main changes)
        - 20.8 Episode 2: A typical CodeRefinery workshop: overview, installation, onboarding, roles, helpers,  co-teaching, screenshare, sound, collaborative doc
        - 27.8 Episode 3: Teaching philosophies, computational thinking (NEW!), personal teaching gems (NEW!)
        - 3.9 Episode 4: Streaming, video editing
    - EuroCC Best practices in HPC training in Oct (2 days between: 21.-23.10)
        - targeting EuroCC network: NCCs and CoEs
        - participants: ~30
        - materials based on last year

## 2024-06-03 The future of the CodeRefinery project
or "in-person retreat wrapup"

- Welcome and introduction

- Current funding situation
  - Mostly in-kind. 0.9 FTE funded by NeIC until Feb 2025 for project management and community management.
  - GitLab services funded by NeIC and operated by DeiC.

- CodeRefinery after Feb 2025
  - Externally funded or in-kind?
    - Initially: in-kind as now but our consortium should and will apply both towards national and international funding calls. 
  - 
  - Project or organization?
    - Team prefers: project and to recommend Digital Research Academy to those requests that our project cannot serve. NordForsk prefers: project.
    - RB will register a company (different name) so that we can invoice workshops on demand where the requestor wants to pay and the project cannot accept it or does not have resources. All output generated by that company will go back to CR open source.
  - Draft for a governance
    - https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/pull/857
    - What will happen with this document?
      - Collect feedback from steering group next week
      - Start a working group to iterate it towards a v1.0 to become our strategy and governance for 2025.
  - "Will my organization participate after Feb 2025?"
    - The question we should ask: What is the strategy and what are the priorities for your organization? What is needed from CR to align CR's strategy and priorities better?

- Future of the GitLab service 
  - In discussion with DeiC about securing a follow-up.
  - RB's goal is to decouple this service from CodeRefinery.

- Workshop formats: Large online workshops or small in-person events?
  - Both!
  - There is interest in both and the project wants to support you in the workshop format that YOU are interested in.
  - Blog post draft: https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/pull/832
  - RD: material should be made suitable for both and both formats encouraged/supported.

- Other blog posts from the Tromso week:
  - https://coderefinery.org/blog/

Document and starting point for this work: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/chat_cleanup

Social media summary:

> In todays meeting we discussed our community Zulip chat and how we could make it more welcoming/easy to use.
> In the upcoming weeks we will update the default and optional channels to fit the community better. Stay tuned and join us: https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com

## Project meeting at NeiC conference (in-person only) at 14.30 CEST
Other notes here: https://hackmd.io/VMpeN632Sli-or3kmzEfOQ


Open topics to discuss (round table):
- project board
- acknowledging people
- website updates
- report writing preparation
- governance
    - current partners need to see that document
    - new partners will want to know
- CR in half a day (4 events upcoming)

    - grow more
        - keep twice a year large workshop
        - other smaller things?
    - partner onboarding

### Outreach

- Think about target audience for workshop outreach 
    - Nordics mainly (not currently working there, so before going on, make it work better in Nordics)
    - Europe (timezone), + we already have partners
    - Aalto and NAISS works well
- Wish for specific roles, who does what 
- copy-pasteable texts for workshop outreach
 -> project board (clear tasks, timing, urgency, assignees)

- Workshop outreach - what is needed to make this a small task
    - List of places to send emails to (!)
        - country, organizations, people 
        - preferably with email addresses
        - > Starting point exists (RB)
    - Page with text about the workshop
        - workshop page has long/short
        - maybe one page in less words?
        - 3 templates (easy scaling later): 
            - who are we? context? not-for-profit, audience, support by X (eg Aalto in Finland)
            - course description, course updates
            - for recurring situations (FYI: CR workshop coming up again on XX)
    - Info on ECTS
    - Template for the outreach email

### Website updates: 
- NEWS section: when is next workshop, link to newsletter as long as there is no workshop page
- How and why to join chat
- Newsletter
- "used/supported by" - to make the website look legit
- New column? (to have this info visible on top of page): How to contact us/get in touch
    - also our sponsors/collaborators "used by"
    - technically: no problem!
    - Maybe not extra column but this content should go somewhere, lets experiment
- Pictures with words instead of lots of text:  https://digital-research.academy/
    - longer term updates, not now "putting out fires"
- RSHour: RB will update the page
    - Could Nordic-RSE take over, to get more people involved?
        - assigment for upcoming topics
    - Needs main coordinator/administration!
    - Goal is to low barrier invite people for shows
> Push directly for uncontroversial content things :) 

- Feedback from NL: make it easier to embed CR in their curriculum
    - Make possible to have own registration
    - Make possible to have own ECTS scheme
    - For us during workshop: Be aware: For some people our workshop might be part of a bigger thing
    - Current hurdle?
        - we have already removed many hurdles
        - no bigger ones

We'll soon also update our [community page](https://coderefinery.org/about/contributors/), where you can then also find our Ambassadors. 
Want to be mentioned there? Join our chat and let us know in #general > CodeRefinery ambassador ; also if you have any more suggestions on how we can support you do your thing.

Notes from this meeting moved to: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/community_teaching
:::

- AOB
    - Could Radovan explain a little about governanace document
       - I will schedule meetings and involve those who raised interest but I did not have time. April was so busy. But the meetings won't happen before June since also May is full. But it's not forgotten. Starting point is the blog post from the Tromso session.
       - From Norwegian Ai Cloud side (Buket that Radovan met) is preparing a proposal as well. in summary we would allocate 50K Nok to be paid to CR, what we ask in return is not clear yet. 
       - > CR meeting in June
    
Social media summary:

We brainstormed the content for a CodeRefinery train-the-trainer training ("what makes our training special?"), decided that we'll pilot a spread out training on four tuesdays in August & September. We also discussed the learning objectives and target audience, and collected a first set of instructors.

Community call summary 2024-04-08

This was our first community call since some time. We have discussed
ideas for an ambassador program where we can send stickers
and t-shirts to those who promote the project and the workshop.

The weekly chat digest is a success and we plan to open it for everybody who wishes to get weekly emails summarizing the community chat.

We have a project board on GitHub! Now it is easier to find a starting point if you want to help and only have one hour time: https://coderefinery.org/tasks/

- CodeRefinery workshop
  - most important lessons learned from week 1?
      - [SR] I was following on twitch and the music is a nice touch. But felt the delay is little too long.
          - It will be nice to inform when the actual lesson starts. e.g.a timer
            - we used the "slide" feature 
          - Is it possible to inclue some detail about where on the lsson we are. Technically should be possible but could be too much work for director
    - lesson change required to change what we ask for for certificates
  - what should we focus on for week 2?

- Citable lessons
  - RB will restart on this after workshop, please reach out if you want to participate
  - Goal: use Zenodo API and GitHub Actions to upload pdf when creating lesson release

- Post-workshop survey blog
  - work in progress, to be published soon

- Governance as basis for future collaboration and funding applications
  - let's start a working group on this. if you are interested in joining, please reach out to RB (chat/email) 
      - Sabry would like to join and will send a ping

- Newsletter
  - RB will send out an email to all subscribers from the former mailing list

Team meeting summary 2024-03-18

We discussed lessons learned from the first #CodeRefinery workshop week and what next steps to focus on for the second course week starting tomorrow.

One thing to improve: indicate on course stream even clearer whether we are in a break or exercise session and when the stream will restart.

    - RD: happy with all basic git stuff, or testing.  Also doing stream stuff.
    - BL: git
    - DP: day3 (have to attend a mandatory 2-days meeting in week2 at my Uni). Happy to contrbute any lesson development
    - MJ: Can do Jupyter lesson 🎉
    - JH: Could take other role(s), e.g. HedgeDoc editor for one of the two weeks
- Two info meetings planned (TBD), one for potential new instructors, one for organizations
    - indicate interest in helping with either here: 
        - RB
        - MJ: I created some how to join stuff at some point so maybe I have some input
        - RD: interested..
        - DP : interested, but will confirm when the date is planned 
- Writing retreat agenda planning meeting on Tuesday 10-12 CET
  - same zoom as this one 
- What is your goal for the writing retreat (important info for agenda design)?
    - RD: How to support those doing outreach and community building.  Git lesson redesign work.
    - RB: setting up a governance so that we have a basis for future decisions about name, account, funding, collaborations
    - RB: redesign first workshop week and basically combine git and github without command line lessons into one
    - MJ: Different models on how to do money in and out
      - what should be free-of-charge? Everything?
      - what could behing paywall to fund operations? Or can we go with other funding?
    - discuss about "CodeRefinery days" at different campuses, focusing on info (this time not a training event)
- New tasks list in progress (github project board): https://github.com/orgs/coderefinery/projects/7
- Ideas about whether and how to provide the bring-your-own code sessions?
  - last time we probably did not describe it enough
  - different communities of supporters could work together and coordinate this better 
- Mastodon toot about this meeting:
```
Our March 12-21 workshop is coming near!  Mostly we are preparing for that in various forms, for example distributing lessons, outreach, re-organizing git lesson. If you want to get involved, now is the time! Let us know via XXX. Also planning for the future: The team will meet soon in Tromsö to discuss the future of the project. Any suggestions? -> Let us know!
```


## 2024-02-05

- Early plans for a Build Systems Hackathon, autumn 2024
    - Online with lectures and tutorials
    - Onsite with hackathon projects
    - Target audience: users? or support staff?
      - software developers for particular software
    - level? basic or intermediate or advanced?
      - intermediate 
    - Tentative dates are online Tue 8 Oct – Thu 10 Oct, half days 9 - 12, followed by  onsite KTH campus Tue 15 Oct – Thu 17 Oct, 9 - 16. 
    - please re-add the calendar invite (problem with the last one was that it started in 2023 so it went for all year every day; but I did not catch this problem as reviewer)
- meeting with [DRA](https://digital-research.academy/) tomorrow; goal?
    - suggestion: discuss what CR / DRA currently is and where we want to go to find synergies?
      - RB: +1. One thing I will suggest that we can forward requests from potential "clients" to them if we cannot provide the requested training ourselves. In other words: cooperation, not competition. Also happy to share and collaborate on any training material if helpful.
      - MJ: Present some CR future ideas and see if we can we find synergies (other than sharing material) eg. operation. What if CR people join DRA?
    - how to join?
        - ask SW, but there should maybe not be too many of us since there is only one Heidi
- Any feedback on workshop survey before sending it out?
  - https://nettskjema.no/a/post-workshop-survey
  - RB: I might add the "prize question" (add your email if you want to win tshirt/stickers) but I am unsure whether I have resources to really follow up. Already pre- and post-processing this will take lots of my time.
    - we add that: N random people will get stickers from us. Only ask for email address. This will be de-coupled from rest of data. 
- In-person meeting Tromso
  - https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/in-person-retreat-2024
  - input on agenda?
    - allocate more time for CR future
    - parallelize: some people might not be interested in governance so offer something in parallel 
  - questions?
  - action point on RB and MJ: organize a meeting before the in-person meeting where we prepare for the future-governance plan
- March workshop
  - questions?
  - website and registration "soon" (just could not find the time yet)
- Nordic RSE conference (in-person) happens in Helsinki, right after NeIC conference


## 2023-01-29

- topical monthly community calls were requested - yes please also from me but it will require volunteering
    - Could be planned in in-person meeting?
- more social media presence - yes please also from me
    - both of above, need dedicated volunteer
    - check again in in-person meeting?
    - unclear what it is/will be about
- first workshop week: please help me deciding whether we should move it to web interface - i can then do most of the work
    - for beginners easier to follow
    - advanced: does not make sense to do everything on web
    - 2nd & 3rd day could switch from web to CLI (if wanted)
        - class could use web, instructions could also be provided for  CLI
    - dedicated meeting for previous teachers + interested people?
- please read https://coderefinery.org/blog/2024/01/24/project-future-concept-board/ (I need to make small fixes)
    - nice summary
    - important: what now, what comes from this? -> in-person meeting
    - from factilitation training POV:
        - next pick some of the most important ideas and start collecting solutions in a similar facilitated workshop
- any ideas where CR mailing list can move to? I have one more month to do that.
    - no ideas, what are requirements? 
    - has indico been used? was there a problem with that?
    - university/partner list?
    - Tool that Heidi Seibold is using? ConvertKit? might not be free?
    - Moosend, HubSpot, Constant Contact, Mailchimp, Brevo (formerly Sendinblue),  Campaign Monitor, AWeber, GetResponse, MailJet
        - No experience on any of these
- CR poster at [Physics Day '24 - Uni Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/conferences/physics-days-2024/programme) (abstract DL 31.1), Aurelie (CSC) could present, help for abstract appreciated, someone interested and have time? -> https://github.com/coderefinery/reports-and-proposals/tree/Physics_day/conference_abstracts
- Fosstodon meeting summary:
  - Meeting summary 29.jan: Should we have more topical community calls where we especially invite others to join? (though all our meetings are open anyway)  Discussion on how to present week one of the course, all web or should we keep the CLI? We need to move our mailing list. Where to? Do you know: Who provides a good mailing list service?


## 2023-01-22

- meeting tomorrow (Tue) about CodeRefinery future
- in-person meeting in Tromso: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/in-person-retreat-2024
- March workshop
  - registration makes more clear that week 1 and week 2 are different
  - week 2: focus on demos and exercise traversal, not so much on making the groups "work"
  - encourage support for week 2 
  - infographics needed to make the registration easier/clearer
    - schedule a dedicated meeting to work on it
- Fosstodon meeting summary
  - Meeting summary: Quick one, mostly preparing for "coderefinery future" tomorrow, in-person writing retreat, and the workshop.  For the spring workshop, most likely: We focus on week 1 (git).  Week 2 will happen if we have enough (new) partners get involved to make it possible (yes, looking at you!).  And make it more clear that week 2 is very different than week 1, so prepare differently.


## 2023-01-15

- In-person planning event: Feb 26 - Mar 1, in Tromso
  - Practical info being added here: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/in-person-retreat-2024
- Video-meeting about CR future: Tue Jan 23, 10-11 CET; RB will add to CR calendar
- Spring workshop
  - 12-14.march for the first week - this much is very likely.
  - Big questions:
    - git week starts from the command line or from web?
    - starting with new repo or from existing?
    - one + one week or we keep the two weeks?
      - develop it so that it can be delivered separately 
    - if we want to keep the bring-your-classroom and want to engage helpers, we need to make week 2 more engaging
    - if we decouple weeks, also decouple install help
    - command line is concepts that apply to everything
    - week one: more branch design
  - Polls to write to chat:
    - adding a) web b) vscode c) nothing
      - remark: the web part is already partially there as alternative, not in all episodes but in many 
    - reordering a) clone-first  b) git init first (like it is now)
    - the second week: a) keep it but make more exercises b) organise it separately in some format
        - OR: edit the registration include some expectation management + separate :heavy_check_mark: for each week
- Summary fosstodon post:
  - In-person meetup confirmed 26Feb-01Mar.  Next week we have a special meeting about CodeRefinery future. (Let us know if you want to take part in either of these.)  Spring workshop still on track, week 1 is most certaintly 12-14Mar.  We'll revise week 1's git material to better match what people do these days, and somehow improve week 2 to better reflect the intrinsic difference in how it's taught.



## 2023-01-08

- In-person event
  - https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/in-person-retreat-2024
  - Feb 26 - Mar 1 ?
  - RB suggestion: let's meet in Tromso?
    - easier for people to arrive and leave with more flexibility (2-4 overnights depending on preference)
    - renting a cabin makes transport more complicated if not everybody arrives and departs at the same time (cabins are sometimes 1-2 hours car ride away)
    - we are too small of a group to be alone in one of the standard places around Tromso so we anyway would have to share with other people
    - meeting rooms at university are "free"
    - there is a lot we can do outside and in town, more than if we are out in a cabin away from town
    - plenty of hiking and skiing and renting gear opportunities
    - we could do one of the dinners at RB's place
- Workflow course dates are set
  - Tu 16.4, 23.4, 7.5, 14.5
- Post-workshop survey to go out this week
  - Please test it: https://nettskjema.no/a/post-workshop-survey (all responses will be wiped before it is sent to participants)
- Workshop planning
  - RB's thoughts:
    - tending towards two events (Git and rest) since there is more interest for Git and it would make requirements clearer
    - start on web instead of command line
    - more puzzle-type (something like advent of code) but without creating barriers
    - try to make it more fun for staff to participate (we seem to have diminishing interest from organizations about in-kind)
    - record puzzle/exercise solutions and use them for marketing the event on social media
  - RD's thoughts:
    - Use existing week 1 dates for git, the rest... week by week?  week 2?
    - we can improve our async learning (videos, writing, guide) and call that a MOOC, even without much more work.  Maybe even tell people to watch that first?
    - Most important question: do we use the reserved dates?
  - TUD will this spring try own workshop based on CR material in MOOC format
- CR relation to other organizations/projects doing similar things (Carpentries, Better Scientific Software, INTERSECT, Digital Research Academy) -> focussed facilitated meeting to find CR team wishes?
  - RB will schedule 1-1 discussions with all team and steering group to hear about what is important for you and what the project should focus on for you and for your organization
- Staff changes
- Fosstodon summary
  - #CodeRefinery team meeting summary: Planning in-person meeting (likely in Tromsø, 26.feb-1.mar) where we will work on material and on project future. Planning upcoming workshop - perhaps separate week 1 (git) from week 2 (repro research) more?  Thinking of ways for outsiders to be able to request and fund dedicated workshops.  If any of these appeal to you, get in touch.

Team meeting summary 2023-12-11

We are working on workshop/tutorial/BoF proposals for 2024. Very soon we will publish our lessons learned from our September workshop as a blog post. After new year we will send out a post-workshop survey to all 2022 and 2023 participants and we are fine-tuning it until then.



## 2023-12-04

- RB restarted planning writing retreat
  - please indicate your interest inside https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/in-person-retreat-2024
- RB working on lessons learned blog post, draft hopefully ready today or tomorrow
- After blog post: work on citable lessons

- New idea: ISC 2024 tutorial: instructor training based on ENCCS instructor training

Mastodon post: With conference deadlines approaching the CodeRefinery team is preparing abstracts to spread the word about teaching practices and material development. Apart from the High Performance Computing world, Which forum should we share our experiences to?


## 2023-11-27

- MJ: Just a question that I wanted to ask:
    - Let's say CR can do whatever and however we want to... What is it that You want to (or don't want to) do for CR?
      - RB: great question. I plan to schedule 1-1 calls with all team and stakeholders and partners and ask almost exactly that :-). What I want to do for CR in 2024 is proposal writing and making it a motivating place to work and contribute to. I still believe in the in-kind model.
      - RD: Get a group of people at organizations to keep co-teaching like we have been (mass communication) - this is where I would focus.  Organizations can work on their own small-group support/teaching.  Another non-profit can support customized teaching (the more I read the more I am interested in working with DRA).
      - CR becomes a center of excellence where different sub-groups can come together and make things happen? Example: https://www.uib.no/en/bjerknes
      - TP: I'm sometimes wondering whether we should, after the big overview courses, offer specialised "topic" lectures, where sessions get expanded (maybe a 3 hour course on a topic if interest for the topic was high enough in the course)

- Workflows course
  - https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/workflowsdevday
  - Ask Enrico to accept title of "workshop lead" and push it forward.
- SciComp/HPC Kickstart course
  - 4-6 June 2024, afternoons.  A lot like before.
- Summary toot for Fosstodon:
   - "Let's say #CodeRefinery can do whatever and however we want to... What is it that you want to (or don't want to) do for CR?" - we discussed this question. And we discussed a #WorkflowsCourse for 2024 (practical examples from us, of everything put together) - anyone want to help prepare this?

Team meeting summary 2023-11-20: We are waiting for more of the team to be back from vacation, but there were many good ideas about our future from the #SuperComputing conference last week.  We have good materials, but need to figure out how to best use and share them in the future. #CodeRefinery



## 2023-11-13
- Decide dates for 2024 CR workshops
  - Spring
    - FI: school holiday 19Feb-23Feb (+ two later weeks in northern regions)
    - SE: school holiday 19Feb-23Feb, 26Feb-1Mar
    - Oslo: 19-23 Feb, Norland: 27feb-3mar, TromsOgFM: 6feb-10feb
  - Autumn
    - FI: not yet decided, likely in november: https://www.hel.fi/en/childhood-and-education/school-term-dates-and-holidays
  - so **12-14mar and 19-21mar** are candidate dates
    - Reserve these dates and second week (and first?) might be extended to a one-lesson-per-week format.
- Workflows course dates?
  - Enrico is on it.
  - Can we use it?
- 
- CR formats?
  - Is CodeRefinery a MOOC already?
  - RD hasn't used the Aalto mycourses (moodle) system much
  - Aplus is developed in CS at Aalto https://apluslms.github.io/ https://plus.cs.aalto.fi/CS-E4004/2020/
  - Who's interested in making this a MOOC?
    - How does making a MOOC contribute to the sustainability?  Needs a sustainability plan.
    - Does giving credits unlock any funding for us?  We'd have to be part of a university then somehow.
      - EuroHPC masters?
      - Or moving it onto a commercial MOOC platform?  But then we lose academic audience/non-profit status.  And may have difficulties managing the conflict of interest with our current employers.
    - Talk to SR

Summary social media post:
CodeRefinery meeting summary 13 Nov 2023: Looking at holiday dates, we think 12-14 and 19-21 March 2024 might work.  Not confirmed yet, and we might change the format (for example one lesson per weeek). When talking about a long-term plan, we were wondering if the public MOOC platforms might provide a sustainable funding source (not changing materials being primarily open-source, of course).

Second social media post [note: make the poll multi-select by clicking on the bullet point]:
What do you think of the current CodeRefinery livestream format?  (public materials, public periodic livestreams for teaching + exercise sessions, public video archives).  What could be added to this?  Please reply with other thoughts and ideas not listed below.
- [ ] Everything is mostly good as it is
- [ ] Add MOOC platform for exercises and certificates
- [ ] Split the livestream into different lessons in different weeks
- [ ] Focus more on in-person interaction


## 2023-11-06

- How can we avoid course overlap in future?
  - own spreadsheet?
  - or a blog post where we share dates?
    - I think some sort of authorative blog post that points to where we are scheduling is good anyway. "If you want to not conflict with our community, see here."
  - or one of the many emerging training portals
    - https://www.eurocc-access.eu/services/training/
    - https://hpc-portal.eu
  - https://coderefinery.github.io/calendar/
  - We can promote our calender by some minimum standards: standards of openness, fitting together, etc.
- Discussing format: MOOC vs "normal workshop"
  - we thought that it would be important to allow project participants to shape different versions of CodeRefinery
  - is CodeRefinery a team? or a brand? or both? 
  - https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/cr_ws_future
  - https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/cr-future-ideas
- (decide dates moved to next week)
- Decide dates for 2024 instructor training
- Focus areas for RB:
  - document what we have done
  - lessons learned blog post
  - citable lessons
  - report about presentations
  - report about participation statistics
  - mid-term report
  - reflect about format
      - https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/cr_ws_future
  - reflect about future of the project 
      - https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/cr-future-ideas
  - in-person meeting planning
      - https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/in-person-retreat-2024
- Chairing next team calls (RB will be at conference and then vacation)

Summary tweet: Today, we talked just a bit about #PythonForSciComp starting tomorrow (follow @SciCompAalto@fosstodon.org) and then had a very long discussion about what we'd like for CodeRefinery for the future: MOOCs?  In-person?  YouTuber/Streamer?  We'd have people interested in all of these and what unifies us is the material. If you are interested in using CodeRefinery material for any of these, get in touch and join our upcoming meetings. #coderefinery


## 2023-10-30

- citable lessons: few people meet on Wednesday about it, you can join
- lessons learned blog-post: RB will start writing tomorrow afternoon after a meeting with TU Delft on this topic 
- focus for next months: sustainability plans and workshop format
- ENCCS instructor training: https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/
- Proposed plan:
  - set tentative workshop dates for 2024 (subject to change, maybe week 2 could turn into one/week)
  - set tentative "instructor training" dates.  Limit 5-10 learners.
    - "Like how CodeRefinery works?  Join us for the next workshop in teaching. Come to instructor training: two focuses, learn how to be co-instructor and learn how to apply our online teaching stuff to your own work."
  - Reach out to instructors/organizations.  Un-block their teaching and invite them to instructor training.
    - Why for them?  Support CodeRefinery (help their)
- By next week: 
  - look at school vacations NO/SE/FI/DK and find those that work.  Also bring in any other requests, and we see.

Summary toot:

We discussed today this question: How can we make it easier for those who want to co-organize and co-teach with us to participate who might be worried that they "are not paid to do this"? How can we convince their management? Also hoping to host a "instuctor training" meeting early 2024 to spread our online teaching + co-instructing techniques.

      - is zulip poll enough?  what dates to offer?
      - 15.jan, 22.jan, 29.jan, 5.feb
  - Help needed: mainly pre-schedule decision making like getting the dates and location.
    - Transportation
    - Coordination 
    - Schedule during the event
  - Places around Tromso:
    - https://en.uit.no/infrastruktur/enhet?p_document_id=675269
    - http://www.haraldvollen.no/
  - Places around Helsinki:
    - Kavalahti, https://partiokampat.fi/kavalahti/, photos: https://papa.kuvat.fi/kuvat/TOIMINTA/Partiok%C3%A4mp%C3%A4t/Kavalahti/
- Lesson development
  - "main" branch is default
  - use "git switch" and "git restore" instead of "git checkout"
      - are installation instrcutinos updated with the minimum version that has these?
        - no
  - git-intro motivation reworked
  - testing lesson reworked
  - git-intro: will probably offer a command-line track (default) and a web track (optional)
  - modular code development: more focus on command-line interface creation

## 2023-08-21

- Steering group meeting tomorrow, agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQ8jzYmVOTa8ETrVbH6jdNDxT1TjTpN8GF2_hQZJXZc/
  - NeIC funding after 2023
  - towards non-profit organization
    - How to get organisations to donate workhours? What do they get?
      - Training for staff: more effective coding workflows, training for trainers
      - Visibility?
      - "we understand your needs better than other commercial companies"
      - freemium model: basic training is free and hackathons and on-demand can cost
- Workshop preparation steps:
  - How-to join video editing (RB)
  - Draft communication
    - Templates link: last workshop is probably the best starting point
  - Draft a plan/infographics/page for self-organized Zoom
  - Detailed schedule
  - Install instructions
  - Adjust [manuals for onboarding](): we have this time a session for video leaders and in-person leaders
- Lesson development: Wed-Fri 
  - The Idea: Choose a lesson, go through, create issues, fix issues
    - How about also practicing the lessons?
  - MJ: A thought: can we make the lesson format to be more like "short introduction and opening discussion, all info on topic, then demo or exercises or discussion" with clear separation/transition in between (RD: +1)
    - This could result to short (10-20min) videos (cut from the recording) and later on the workshop moves towards practical doing
      - I know we have been trying to do it earlier. My feeling is that this strictier structure would give the result more production value.
- Streamlining idea: instead of workshop..
  - We could do videos + regular Q&A sessions
    - Many benefits: please list here
      - Much easier to organise those smaller Q&A's or miniworkshops that have each time a certain topic
      - More streamlined work
    - Some possible drawbacks:
      - People join live stuff for the ambience
      - There's also something in joining an event
- Toot :elephant: 
  - Lesson development retreat happens this week. 
  - In the weekly team meeting the discussion went on to different possibilities in sharing knowledge. Would you rather participate in 2-week workshop or watch short videos and attend a monthly Q&A-session? Share your thoughts now, or join the workshop (https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/) and let us know afterwards.

## 2023-07-31

- Online writing retreat: decide about dates
  - currently Aug 23-25 looks best but only 2 votes so far
- RB working on "CodeRefinery in 1 hour" talk
  - part of PDC summer school
  - including 3x30 min exercises: git/github, cmake, containers
- We are invited to send an abstract to https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2023/
  - we can condense the RSEcon/SC abstracts to a lightning talk
- We are invited to contribute a paper about CodeRefinery
  - > Based on your presentation entitled “CodeRefinery: What We Learned from Teaching Software Engineering Practices to Students and Researchers in Nordics and Beyond” in SIAM CSE23, we wanted to invite you to consider writing a paper as an article for the Software Engineering Department in the Computing in Science & Engineering magazine, published by IEEE, which we edit. The Software Engineering Department accepts both peer-reviewed and editorial content. We are happy to discuss the options with you to choose the one that best fits your needs.  If you are interested, please contact us with your idea so we can help make sure it is a good fit. In addition, if you have other ideas or topics that you would like to write about, we are interested in discussing those with you. You can find more details about the Department here: https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/cs/track-calls-for-papers#Software%20Engineering
  - we are looking for people who would like to be co-author
      - SW interested
      - MJ interested in greating figures
  - Articles for this track should not exceed 6,000 words, including all main body, bibliography, biography, and table text. Each table and figure counts for 250 words.
  - Motivation: one could finally cite us, currently we can only point to the project URL
- Citable lessons
  - adding CITATION.cff to all lessons is the first step (everything else is either easy or not so important) 


### Mastodon summary toots

We will now try something new: concluding each of our weekly team calls with a short summary on Mastodon (coming up in next toot).

This way the community can stay informed and another bonus is that it encourages us to reach a conclusion that is short to read and easy to communicate to those who were not at the meeting.



Team meeting summary 2023-07-31

We are planning an online writing retreat for our lesson content for end of August. The retreat gives an opportunity to develop material together. To join, please find us on chat or subscribe to the calendar invite (https://coderefinery.org/calendars/).

Improved citability: Our goal is to make it possible to cite individual lessons.

Working on conference presentations (RSECon'23 confirmed, SC'23 WIP) and starting a manuscript towards a paper about CodeRefinery.
